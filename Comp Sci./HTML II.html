        <h1>Hawaii’s History</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hawaiʻi’s history stretches from its early settlement by Polynesian voyagers to the rise of a unified island kingdom under Kamehameha I. For much of the 19th century, Hawaiʻi existed as an independent monarchy, maintaining diplomatic relations with major world powers. In 1893, the Hawaiian Kingdom was overthrown by a group of residents backed by U.S. interests, leading eventually to its annexation by the United States in 1898. After decades as a U.S. territory, Hawaiʻi moved toward full political integration, and in 1959 it achieved statehood, becoming the 50th state of the United States.</p>
